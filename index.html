        <div class="subheading mb-5">Pre-Business</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">First year student studying business at the University of California, Riverside. Planning to concentrate in marketing and to minor in graphic design. Has knowledge about Microsoft Office Applications, such as Google Docs, Excel, Access, and Powerpoint. Grew up learning two foreign languages but only lightly fluent in Mandarin and Cantonese. (Cannot read or write but able to casually converse in the language) Finished Calculus in college; proficiency in mathematics. Expected graduation date in June, 2023. <br><br>

        Being a part of the Supporting Transitions and Aspirations Mentorship Program (STAMP) for an entire year now, I attended bi-weekly workshops, where I learned in depth about community issues and leadership skills. I spontaneously decided to apply to become a junior project coordinator. As a JPC, I had to lead these bi-weekly workshops as well as attend an additional meeting with other JPCs that I worked with. Going through the process of planning and creating workshops, I learned how to cooperate and think critically about the different ways we could teach approach various topics. Being in a small group, I began to share my ideas and offered constructive criticism when appropriate. Also as a JPC, I got to experience giving interviews for the mentees that applied for our program, managing time slots for each interview and negotiating a time that would benefit both parties. After getting to know each of the participants, I began to cultivate stronger relationships with my participants, and I greatly wanted to develop their individual skills into a flourishing talent. I learned about problem solving and how to think of a solution when under pressure. My leadership and collaboration skills were greatly enhanced. This experience also helped me open up to others and communicate better with both my peers and mentees that were in the program. I also worked with several adults who helped and guided me towards my success in this program.<br><br>

        At the end of this program, all participants were held accountable for creating their own workshop and presenting it to other youth in our community. The event was called Asian Pacific Islander Summit (API Summit). As a project coordinator, I helped participants gather their materials, made an itinerary of the event, and checked people in as they arrived for the event. I checked in with each of the groups making sure that they were okay during the process. I ushered the youth that participated in the API event to their correct workshop rooms. I worked with other JPCs to ensure that all participants had a great time during the summit. The API Summit was an event that I was a participant in last year. I held created and facilitated my own workshop with two other participants. The workshop was about substance abuse and was taught to about 40 youth in our community. Each of the workshops lasted about an hour and thirty minutes and we held two workshops during the API. This experience has helped me grow my leadership skills as well as my communication and organization skills.
